# Bank-Loan-Report

To effectively monitor and assess the bankâ€™s lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. By leveraging this report, we can make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio, and identify trends that will inform our lending strategies.
